# DC-GAN

A detailed report of its functioning is also attached.

DCGAN is one of the popular and successful network design for GAN. 

It mainly composes of convolution layers without max pooling or fully connected layers. 

It uses convolutional stride and transposed convolution for the downsampling and the upsampling.

Pre-trained weights of the generator and discriminator are also available in gan-g.pt, gan-d.pt files respectively.

Dataset used is CIFAR-10
